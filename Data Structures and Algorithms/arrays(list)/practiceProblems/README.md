# Python Lists(Arrays) Practice problems
1. Sum and Average of List Elements
Write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns both the sum and average of the elements in the list.

2. Find the Maximum and Minimum
Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns both the minimum and maximum values in the list without using the built-in min() and max() functions.

3. Reverse a List
Given a list of integers, write a Python function that returns the list in reverse order. Do not use the reverse() method.

4. Count Even and Odd Numbers
Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and counts how many numbers are even and how many are odd.

5. Rotate an Array
Given a list of integers, rotate the array to the right by n positions. For example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and n = 2, the result should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].

6. Find the Second Largest Element
Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns the second largest number in the list.

7. Merge Two Sorted Lists
Write a Python function that takes two sorted lists of integers and merges them into a single sorted list.

8. Remove Duplicates from a List
Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with duplicates removed, preserving the order of the elements.

9. Check if a List is a Palindrome
Write a function that checks whether a given list of integers is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

10. Find Common Elements Between Two Lists
Write a function that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing only the elements that are common to both lists.

11. Find the Missing Number
Given a list of numbers from 1 to n with one number missing, write a function to find the missing number.

12. Sum of Diagonal Elements in a 2D Array
Given a 2D array (list of lists), write a function that returns the sum of the diagonal elements of the array.

13. Find the Most Frequent Element
Write a function that finds the most frequent element in a list of integers.

14. Move Zeroes to the End
Write a function that moves all zeroes in a list to the end while preserving the order of the other elements.

15. Flatten a 2D Array
Write a function that takes a 2D array (a list of lists) and flattens it into a 1D list.
